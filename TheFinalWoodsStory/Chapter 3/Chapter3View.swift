Initially nothing about this path seemed threatening. She felt at ease, immersed in the beauty of the lush forest. About an hour in, her perception started to change. The behavior of the creatures and plants got a bit alarming. There was a Wise Old Owl with a potion stand, so she stopped to inquire if the Owl knew about the wizard. His assistant The Green Baboon demanded her to pick a potion.")
